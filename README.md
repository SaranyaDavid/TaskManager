# TaskManager
 Develop a responsive task manager application that allows users to dynamically add, edit, and delete tasks.   Utilize React state for local state management and implement CRUD operations without relying on backend APIs, storing all task data in local storage.

 
- Integrate React Context for efficient global state management of tasks. 
- Implement a responsive feature for marking tasks as completed. 
- Enhance the application by adding the ability to categorize tasks.
